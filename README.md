# Advanced-Data-Science-Machine-Learning

In this course, we will be learning and applying all the steps required to build successful machine learning models. 

We will work with real-world data sets, and go through the steps in the data science workflow to build successful machine learning models. Exploring the Data and “Feature Engineering” are some of the most important steps required to develop machine learning models, and this course will be heavily focused around that. 

We will learn the theory on different types of machine learning algorithms - supervised (regression, classification) and unsupervised learning in particular - learn how to evaluate these algorithms and develop our own machine learning models.
